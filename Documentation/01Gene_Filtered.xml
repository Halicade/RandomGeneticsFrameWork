	Using Gene_Filtered, you can use filters to select genes that will be chosen.
	Note all filter options are optional.
	
	There is a list of genes you may want to exclude in 05Notes.xml
	
	Possible filters include:
	<exclusionTags> if a gene has these exclusionTags, it will be counted
	<excluded> if a Genedef is named one of these it will be excluded
	<minMetabolism> defaults to -999
	<maxMetabolism> defaults to 999
	<minComplexity> defaults to -999
	<maxComplexity> defaults to 999
	<minArchite> defaults to 0
	<maxArchite> defaults to 0
	<canHaveAbility> defaults to true.
	-If the filter has <canHaveAbility> it will include regular genes and genes that have abilities based on the <ability> tag.
	<onlyHasAbility> defaults to false.
	-If the filter has <onlyHasAbility> it will only include genes if they have an <ability> tag.
	-If you have <canHaveAbility> false and <onlyHasAbility> true, it will not run the filter.
	<canHavePrerequisite> defaults to false.
	-If the filter has <canHavePrerequisite> that means the gene can have a prerequisite listed.
	-Note that this will not check if the pawn in question has that prerequisite. It can add a gene regardless of the prerequisite status
	<needsPrerequisite> blank by default
	-If the filter has <needsPrerequisite> the genes listed inside will need to match the GeneDefs prerequisite
	<timesToRepeat> defaults to 1
	-If the filter has <timesToRepeat> at a value larger than 1, it will try to insert another gene that matches the criteria that many times
	-This gene assignment follows the same logic as vanilla,
		-if the same gene is added as a germline gene, it will not be added
		-if the same gene is added as a xenogene, there will be a duplicate
	<defType> defaults to "Verse.GeneDef"
	-<defType> is used for subclasses of genes. These are for genes not tagged as <GeneDef>.
	-The only ones I know of that do this so far are:
	-Vanilla Races Expanded - Android "VREAndroids.AndroidGeneDef"
	-Vanilla Races Expanded - Insector "VanillaRacesExpandedInsector.GenelineGeneDef"
	-->
	
	
	<!--
	In this example, it will search for any genes that use the exclusionTags HairStyle or Immunity
	This will exclude PerfectImmunity because we did not change maxArchite
	You will have an equal chance of getting any gene in this example.
	Base game you would get:
	Hair_BaldOnly
	Hair_ShortOnly
	Hair_LongOnly
	Immunity_Weak
	Immunity_Strong
	Immunity_SuperStrong
